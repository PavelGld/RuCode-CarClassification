RuCode-CarClassification 2022

Here we present one of the variants of the basic solution for the RuCode-2022 competition in the task of classifying cars in an image by their color.

A convolutional neural network was used to perform this task. In the course of the competition, the application of the PrReLu activation function showed particular efficiency.
